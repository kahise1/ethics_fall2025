## ABSTRACT
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by helping doctors detect diseases faster and more accurately. One growing use is in skin cancer diagnosis, where AI systems analyze images to identify cancerous spots. However, recent research shows that many of these systems perform less accurately on darker skin tones because they are trained mostly on images of lighter skin. This creates an ethical challenge: while AI can save lives through early detection, it may also harm underrepresented groups by giving unequal results.

This case study explores the issue of racial bias in AI skin-cancer diagnostic tools, focusing on the ethical dilemma between innovation and fairness. It examines how unbalanced training data can lead to health disparities, who is affected, and what actions can ensure justice and safety for all patients. Finally, the study discusses possible solutions such as requiring diverse medical datasets, fairness testing, and stronger oversight before AI tools are used in clinical settings.
