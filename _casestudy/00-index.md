## ABSTRACT
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is transforming healthcare by improving disease detection. In dermatology, AI analyzes skin images to identify cancer, enabling faster diagnoses. However, many AI systems perform less accurately on darker skin because they are trained primarily on lighter-skinned images. This creates an ethical challenge: while AI can save lives through early detection, it may also perpetuate health inequities.

This case study examines racial bias in AI skin-cancer diagnostic tools, focusing on ethical dilemmas between innovation and fairness. It explores how unbalanced training data can harm patients with darker skin, identifies affected stakeholders, and discusses solutions such as diverse datasets, fairness testing, and regulatory oversight.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this case study, participants should be able to:

1. Understand AI in dermatology: Describe how AI systems are trained and used to detect skin cancer.

2. Identify ethical challenges: Recognize how biased training data can affect diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

3. Assess impacts on stakeholders: Explain how patients, clinicians, hospitals, and AI developers are affected by unequal AI performance.

4. Consider ethical responsibilities: Discuss strategies for ensuring fairness, equity, and transparency in AI deployment.

5. Reflect on decision-making: Apply ethical reasoning to determine how healthcare organizations can responsibly implement AI tools.

[Let's Talk about stakeholders](03-stakeholders/)

Discover who is affected by AI in dermatology and what their responsibilities are.  
- **Patients** (especially darker-skin patients): need safe, fair diagnoses
- **Doctors and nurses**: need reliable systems to trust in decision-making
- **Hospitals**: want to use AI but must ensure patient safety
- **AI companies**: build tools and must fix bias issues
- **Government/regulators**: protect public health and fairness
- **Society**: wants equal access to accurate medical care
