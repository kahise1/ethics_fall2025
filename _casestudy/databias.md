## Data and Bias
AI-driven dermatology tools rely heavily on the quality, diversity, and representativeness of their training data. Algorithms are trained using vast collections of images of skin lesions, often labeled with diagnoses and patient outcomes. Through deep learning, AI systems can identify subtle visual patterns and suggest likely diagnoses for new cases. Studies, including one led by the Stanford Center for Digital Health, have shown that AI assistance can improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity across clinicians, particularly benefiting medical students, nurse practitioners, and primary care doctors (Conger, 2024). Even dermatologists’ accuracy improves modestly when using AI, demonstrating the potential of these tools to enhance patient care.

Despite these benefits, the ethical and clinical performance of AI is fundamentally constrained by the data on which it is trained. If datasets underrepresent darker skin tones, AI models may misdiagnose or under-diagnose patients with higher melanin levels, amplifying existing disparities in dermatology (Chen et al., 2024). Such biases are not merely technical flaws—they pose real risks to patient safety, threaten equitable care, and may erode trust in both clinicians and AI systems.

Beyond representativeness, questions of data privacy, ownership, and consent are ethically significant. Patient images are often shared with AI developers, sometimes without clear consent or compensation. Black box models, which obscure how algorithms reach decisions, can further compromise patient autonomy by making clinical reasoning less transparent. Ensuring informed consent requires transparency about how patient data will be used and how AI recommendations influence clinical decisions.

Finally, implementing AI responsibly demands attention to distributive justice. Differences in image quality, labeling, and algorithm design can result in unequal performance across healthcare settings and populations. High-quality, diverse datasets and standardized evaluation protocols are essential to ensure that AI tools benefit all patients rather than exacerbating existing inequities (Chen et al., 2024). Collaboration between developers, clinicians, and regulators, alongside rigorous ethical oversight, is therefore critical to translate the potential of AI into safe, equitable dermatological care.
