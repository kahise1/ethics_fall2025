Exploring how generative AI play a role in understanding of creativity, ownership, and fairness in digital culture.

## Summary of the Case Study
The case study **"ARTificial: Why Copyright Is Not the Right Policy Tool to Deal with Generative AI"** argues that copyright law is not the right policy tool for dealing with generative AI because it cannot adequately address questions of consent, attribution, fairness, or the broader social harms created by AI. Instead of focusing only on copyright, the article urges a more holistic, ethical, and societal approach to regulating Generative Artificial Intelligence.

Before diving into the discussion questions, I wanted to reflect on how the article connects to my own understanding of creativity and technology. The case study doesn’t just describe legal conflicts, the case study shows how generative AI exposes deeper tensions between human expression, machine capability, and economic power. Keeping that perspective in mind, the following are my thoughts on four of the key questions raised in the reading.

## DISCUSSION
One of the central questions Mantegna introduces is **whether training generative AI on unlicensed works constitutes fair use or copyright infringement**. Many assume that AI training simply “copies” artists’ works, but the legal reality is more complicated. Whether training is a violation depends on how the model processes information, whether it stores data, and how similar the outputs are to the original works. Mantegna also notes that many people mistakenly equate what is unethical with what is illegal.

From my perspective, even if the law determines that certain forms of AI training qualify as fair use, creators still deserve meaningful control over how their work is used. Given how quickly AI technology develops, it is easy to see how artists may feel that they have no voice in the process. Legally, a model may be considered “transformative,” but ethically, creators should still be entitled to informed consent rather than learning about the use of their work only after the fact.

The article also addresses the question of **originality** in AI-generated outputs. Copyright law requires a “modicum of creativity” for a work to be protected, but generative AI challenges long held assumptions about what originality means. If an AI-produced image can convincingly imitate human-made art, should it be treated differently? Mantegna points out that the principle of “aesthetic neutrality” prohibits courts from judging creativity based on the source.

Despite this, I do not believe AI outputs should receive copyright protection. Allowing companies to copyright those works would primarily benefit corporations, not the human creators whose work was used to train the models. This could overwhelm the public domain and place even greater restrictions on human creativity. In my view, creativity should remain tied to human intention, emotion, and experience qualities AI systems cannot replicate.

Another question Mantegna raises is whether **AI-generated outputs should receive any form of copyright protection at all**. My answer is no. It is inconsistent to use the creative labor of human artists to train AI, provide no compensation or attribution to those artists, and then claim copyright protection for the generated outputs. Granting copyright to AI-generated works would shift even more power toward the corporations that develop these systems and further disadvantage independent human creators. AI does not possess authorship in a meaningful or legal sense, and copyright should not be extended to machine generated content.

Finally, the case study considers whether **a distinction should be made between autonomous AI creations and AI-assisted works**. I believe such a distinction is necessary. Using AI as a tool to assist human creators.For example, to speed up repetitive tasks in animation, is reasonable and can support the creative process. In these cases, humans remain the primary creators. However, fully autonomous AI creations, which generate content entirely from a text prompt, feel fundamentally different. These works lack human intention and risk flooding the creative market with endless machine-produced content. If it were up to me, such autonomous outputs would not exist at all.

## My Discussion Question
After reading the case study and thinking through these questions, I also came up with one question:
**As Generative Artificial Intelligence continues to improve, do you see it getting more difficult to distinguish between Generative Artificial Intelligence and original human-made works?**
I asked this because I remember when I started using generative AI to generate images, the images used to look funny and unrealistic. It was so easy to tell an AI image from a real one. But now, AI images look almost perfect, even the hands look normal. It’s a little scary how fast the technology is improving. If it keeps getting better, we might not be able to tell the difference between AI art and real human art, and that makes me worry about how people will value human creativity in the future. Are we going to visite musiums for potraits?

## Reflection
This case study changed how I think about AI, creativity, and fairness. I used to assume copyright could protect artists from other people using their work even AI systems, but now I see how limited that approach is. Copyright is slow and reactive, while AI evolves at lightning speed. The real challenge is deeper; AI touches ethics, labor, culture, and even identity. I also realized that artists are not just fighting technology; they’re fighting the power structures behind it. Mantegna’s article helped me understand that solving this issue will require new policies, new forms of compensation, and new ways of valuing human creativity or give it more credits.
