This blog explores my journey as a writer and the lessons I learn through each post.

Looking back at the blogs I wrote this semester, the one that stands out the most is my post on machine learning harms, **BIAS Blog 2**. I chose this as my “most informative” blog because it pushed me to understand the machine learning lifecycle more deeply than I had before. The case study outlined seven sources of harm, and writing about historical and representation biases helped me connect those ideas to my own experiences—like Siri misunderstanding my accent or LinkedIn making narrow assumptions about my career interests. These moments made the post feel rich and meaningful. It also challenged me to think beyond the idea that “data is biased” and recognize that every step of technical development involves an ethical choice.

Another post that meant a lot to me was **INFO Blog 1**, where I wrote about misinformation and censorship. This blog felt more personal, especially when I reflected on the rumor in Tanzania about poisoned water during an election. Remembering how scared people were made me realize how fast misinformation can spread and how much harm it can cause. While writing this post, I noticed a shift in my writing—I felt more comfortable connecting course ideas to real events in my life instead of only summarizing what the article said.

The blog I revised the most was the one on machine learning harms. At first, I focused only on bias in data. Later in the course, as I learned more about representation harms, deployment harms, and other types of harm, I rewrote the post to include clearer examples and deeper explanations. I could see my writing becoming more organized and thoughtful across the semester.

Overall, blogging helped me improve my writing skills. I became better at explaining complex ideas in simple language and choosing examples that connect directly to my point—especially experiences I used to view differently. I still struggle with writing too much or making long paragraphs, mostly because I have many examples and don’t always know which ones to leave out. But I’ve gotten better at staying focused. I also realized that I enjoy writing blogs more than traditional essays. Blogs feel less strict and more natural, and writing for an online audience made me think about being clear, relatable, and honest instead of overly formal.

I also noticed patterns in my writing. I usually start with a real-life example to connect to a bigger idea, and I often end with a question (especially because the professor encouraged it). Over time, I became more comfortable admitting when I wasn’t fully sure about something and exploring my thoughts instead of trying to sound perfect.

The topics I enjoyed most were misinformation and machine learning because they relate directly to everyday life. I also wish we had talked more about how different people—and even different countries—handle technology ethics, because technology affects people differently depending on where they live. Writing the blogs helped me understand course concepts more deeply. One moment that truly “clicked” for me was realizing that censorship is not just about removing content—it affects trust, justice, and even the distribution of power.

Now that I have my own website, I can imagine using it in the future to share school projects, internships, or maybe even new blog posts. Even if I don’t post regularly, I want to keep the website as a professional space. I even linked it in one of my internship applications. Looking ahead, I see myself becoming a writer who can explain technical ideas clearly and in a way that makes sense to anyone. I want to explore more technical and reflective writing as I continue my studies.

If I had to choose one writing goal for next semester, it would be to become more brief and focused. I want to express my ideas clearly without using too many extra sentences or examples. To reach that goal, I plan to revise my work more often, ask others for feedback, and read more of other people’s writing.
