Exploring how censorship, misinformation, and trust shape the online spaces we use every day.

**The Talk:**  
[Censorship of Misinformation and Freedom of Speech on Social Media](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/lkf63cu5/release/1)
by Kevin A.I. Mills

## Summary of the Case Study
Mills explores the question of whether social media companies should censor misinformation. He argues that censorship might seem helpful but often makes things worse by deepening mistrust and dividing people. The real problem, he explains, is not just false information—it’s a breakdown of trust in experts, institutions, and each other. Censorship can’t fix that; rebuilding healthy communication and shared understanding can.

## DISCUSSION

### 1. Examples of Misinformation Today
One major example I’ve seen is the spread of false health advice online. During COVID-19, many posts claimed to offer “natural cures” or pushed vaccine conspiracy theories that confused a lot of people around me. Even today, there are still people who don’t trust vaccines because of those rumors and misinformation. I also notice more misleading content about climate change and politics, where people spread exaggerated or false claims to fit their beliefs.  

A more recent example I remember is what happened in Tanzania during the election. There was a rumor going around that the water had been poisoned. This caused widespread fear and panic across the country, especially because it happened during a time of crisis. It wasn’t until government officials came out to explain that the story was false that things calmed down. This shows how powerful and dangerous misinformation can be on social media, one false post can reach millions of people within minutes.  

### 2. Institutions That Share Reliable Information
News organizations, schools, and government agencies are supposed to give us accurate information, but fewer people trust them today. I think part of the problem is that everyone now lives in their own “information world” online. For example, I’ve seen friends trust influencers more than official experts simply because they “sound more real.” These changes show that the systems meant to guide us are struggling to compete with the speed and personalization of social media.  

Even for me, it’s hard to know who to trust anymore because so much of the information we get feels biased. I remember during one event, the regional commissioner of Dar es Salaam told people not to trust outside news sources and to wait for updates only from local authorities. But that made me wonder—if respected global outlets like *Al Jazeera* are known for reliable reporting, why should we completely dismiss them? It’s confusing when different institutions tell us to trust only their version of the truth. This situation shows how easily trust can break down when everyone claims to have the “real” story.  

### 3. Would Censorship Be Justified if It Worked?
I think if censorship could truly stop misinformation without hurting free speech, maybe it would be worth it in some cases—like when misinformation directly harms people, such as false medical claims. But in reality, censorship often backfires. When a post or account gets taken down, many users believe the truth is being hidden from them. Instead of solving the problem, it can increase suspicion and make misinformation even more appealing.  

### 4. How Digital Technology Changed Information Flow
Today, technology has made it easier than ever to learn, communicate, and share ideas. I’ve personally learned coding, languages, and history from online resources. But the same openness allows rumors and false claims to spread quickly. Algorithms often prioritize engagement over accuracy, so emotional or extreme content gets promoted. I think technology is both a gift and a challenge. It connects us, but it also tests how well we can handle and judge too much information. 

## My Discussion Question
**How can social media platforms rebuild trust between users who strongly disagree about what’s true or false?**  
I came up with this question because the article made me realize that misinformation grows when people lose trust in each other. Instead of just removing posts, maybe platforms need to find ways to encourage respectful discussion and empathy again. Or evan give feedbacks on those posts.

## Reflection
This article made me think differently about free speech and misinformation. I used to believe deleting false posts was the obvious solution, but now I see that it’s not that simple, because what if someone already screenshot or shared to others?. The real problem is the lack of trust between users, institutions, and entire communities. I’ve seen this happen in my own online spaces, where arguments turn personal fast and no one listens anymore. Mills’ argument reminded me that we can’t “fix” misinformation by silencing people. We have to rebuild trust, honesty, and patience in how we talk to each other online.
