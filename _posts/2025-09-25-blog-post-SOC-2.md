## Summary of the case study
The MIT case study *From Mining to E-Waste* examines how every stage of the electronics life cycle—mining, manufacturing, and disposal—produces environmental harm and reinforces global inequality. Using environmental and climate justice as frameworks, it highlights how marginalized communities, especially in the Global South, carry the burden of deforestation, pollution, and health risks tied to global technology consumption. It also introduces **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** and **Circular Economy (CE)** as tools to evaluate and address these injustices.

## Section: Mining, Deforestation, and Forest Fires
### Can mining for economic development and climate justice coexist?
I think mining can only support climate justice if it does as little harm as possible. Mining causes deforestation, pollution, and carbon emissions, and countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, and Somalia feel the worst effects. These nations need mining for economic growth, but they often don’t have the systems to manage its environmental damage. Climate justice in mining, to me, means finding a balance—supporting communities without destroying the land and ecosystems they rely on.

### Does the potential benefit of “green” technology outweigh the costs to local communities and environments?
Green technology is supposed to help the planet, but it still depends on mining that hurts people and the environment. At this point, not really. For example, cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo helps make batteries for electric cars, but it also causes child labor, conflict, and unsafe living conditions. That makes it hard to call it truly “green.” Real sustainability, in my view, means protecting both the Earth and the people who live on it.

### LCA for mining in the Amazon
An **LCA** could focus on measuring deforestation rates, greenhouse gas emissions, and health outcomes in nearby Indigenous communities. Stakeholders would include Indigenous peoples, and the impact category could center on respiratory illness caused by forest-fire pollution. This analysis would reveal the real human and environmental costs of mining and help push for stronger protections and corporate accountability.

## Section: The Growing E-Waste Crisis
### What challenges might arise when implementing solutions to e-waste issues?
One big challenge is making sure everyone actually follows the rules. Many wealthy countries still send their e-waste to poor countries where the laws and regulations are weaker. Even with “right to repair” laws or recycling programs, it’s hard to make big companies take real responsibility and accountability. I also think about the people who work with e-waste just to make a living. For them, recycling isn’t a choice—it’s survival. So if we ban those jobs without giving them other options, it could hurt more than help. Any real solution has to protect both the environment and the people who depend on it. We need better ways to manage e-waste without harming either side.

### How do the climate justice implications of e-waste relate to other social justice issues in the Global South?
Thinking about e-waste makes me realize how connected climate issues are to fairness and equality. People in countries like Ghana, India, and Nigeria often handle toxic electronics just to make a living, while many in wealthier countries keep buying new devices without thinking about the harm. The dangers to their health, the unfair working conditions, and the damage to the environment feel like part of a bigger pattern of exploitation. It shows me that caring about the climate also means caring about people and their rights.


## My Discussion Question
**How can consumers in the Global North take meaningful responsibility for the e-waste and mining impacts of the electronics they buy, beyond just recycling or purchasing “eco-friendly” products?**

I chose this question to encourage myself and readers to think beyond awareness. Real change means rethinking consumption habits, supporting right-to-repair movements, and demanding corporate transparency. The goal is to challenge individuals and institutions to act collectively for global justice.

## Reflection
This case study made me reconsider how my everyday tech use connects to hidden cycles of extraction and exploitation. I have upgraded my phone and laptop many times without realizing the human and environmental cost. Maybe I don’t need to upgrade every time a new version comes out, since so much goes into making these products. This study helped me understand how climate and environmental justice are linked to the technology industry and to my own role as a consumer. Going forward, I want to support repairable products, advocate for better recycling systems, and use technologies that prioritize fairness and sustainability.
