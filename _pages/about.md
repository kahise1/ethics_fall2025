This page is meant for you to use to showcase your case study and podcasts, as well as host your blog posts that you'll create for our readings. You will need to update the content on this page and submit to Moodle (see calendar). Once updated, you can delete this short paragraph and the help guide at the bottom so that only the About Me, Research, and Personal Life are showing.
