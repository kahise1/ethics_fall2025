4. Host with GitPages. Go to Settings>Pages>Branch. Click master from drop-down and Save
5. Enable URL. Go to Code > About > Gear icon > Website. Click 'Use your GitHub Pages website' and Save. This may take a minute to load.
6. Create Codespace. Go to Code dropdown > Codespaces > Create codespace on master. This takes a few minutes.
7. While you wait for codespaces, look for an profile pic to add. It can be a picture of you, or an avatar that you like. Name the file profile.jpg, and upload to the images folder. You can upload via Github. There should already be a file profile.png that you are overwritting. 
8. View _config.yml. Go to Basic Site Settings and update your name, url, and repo. Replace Prof Kim's information with your own. Then scroll down to links and update to your liking.
9. View about.md in _pages. Update your name from Prof. Kim's. This page will need to be updated with your information by the deadline in the course schedule.
