Episode Summary: “ID: Null”
In the near future, society runs on biometric microchip implants that replace IDs, money, and communication devices. Every citizen’s identity is stored in a massive global database controlled by corporations and governments. When Alex, a software engineer, arrives at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Tanzania, his chip scan flashes “ID: Null” — meaning his entire digital identity has been erased. Suddenly, he can’t access his funds, contact his family, or even prove he exists.

As Alex searches for answers, he discovers others who have been “nulled” too — people erased from society for political or social reasons. Using his technical skills, he uncovers a hidden system that lets authorities deactivate citizens at will, turning digital life into a tool of control.

“ID: Null” explores the ethical dangers of surveillance, data power, and dependence on technology. It asks: What happens when your very existence depends on a system you don’t control — and what if that system decides you no longer exist?
